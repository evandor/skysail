@singleEntityRefApplication
Feature: [Ref.App SingleEntity] - account specific features - HTML 

    An account is an entity with a non-empty name, an iban and a non-empty creation date.
    
    These tests assume that the user is authenticated and has the appropriate roles; initially,
    the database is empty (but there is no guarantee of the execution order of the tests).
    
    The media type used here is not relevant as nothing gets actually rendered in these tests.

Background: 
    Given a running AccountApplication

    
Scenario: updating an account entity
     When I add an account like this:
       | name | another account |
     And I change its 'name' to 'another account II'
     And I open the account page
     Then the page contains 'another account II'

Scenario: deleting an account
     When I add an account like this:
       | name | account2beDeleted |
     And I delete it again
     And I query all accounts
     Then the result does not contain an account with name 'account2beDeleted'
